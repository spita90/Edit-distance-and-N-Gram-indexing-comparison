# Edit-distance-and-N-Gram-indexing-comparison

This software compares Edit-distance and N-Gram-indexing algorithms for word matching.
These algorithms are widely used in most common softwares for word typing prediction or for grammatical correction of a document.

These algorithms implement dynamic programming and use an italian dictionary of 660000 word (provided by GitHub user Francesco Napoletano).

The PDF document (in italian) gives a deep analysis of the comparison.
